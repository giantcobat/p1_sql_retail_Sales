# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis – SQL Project

## 📌 Overview

This SQL project explores and analyzes retail sales data stored in a **MySQL** database (p1_retail_db). It demonstrates key data analysis tasks such as setting up a database, cleaning data, and writing SQL queries to uncover business insights. The dataset includes transaction details like sale date, customer demographics, product category, quantity, and sales amounts.
